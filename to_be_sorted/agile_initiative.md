# Agile Initiative

> TL;DR: Getting pin-cushioned should be a thing

It's all about making plans that are often going to fall apart when they intersect with the plans of others.

1. Have everyone make a plan for what their characters are going to do
1. Evaluate the intersections of those plans one action step at a time
1. Resolve conflicts through dialogue, and rolls.
With initiative or speed rolls, being used to decide who goes first each time.
